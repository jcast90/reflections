When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your files or collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That way you can be in control of what is on your remote repository, only pulling the important files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Being able to view it when offline.
