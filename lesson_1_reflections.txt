How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It made it a lot more simple to compare the files side by side with their differences. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would help me so that I could then go back and compare files and find bugs a lot quicker. 

What do you think are thr pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: you don't have a too many commits and it's not very cluttered. 
Cons: Human error. Sometimes you may forget about commiting or don't do it enough or do it too much.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

To save space and to keep them organized.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history files?

You can use git log in order to see all saved versions of a file along with any comments regarding changes. You can then use git diff to compare two documents to see what changes were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It will allow you the opportunity to find where the change went wrong and in which document it is located so it can be fixed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
